# EDT PDV Test Code

Code to test the basics of setting up the EDt PDV driver API and lining to the functions.

This code also uses the sierra-olympic, wind_protocol and fip_protocols to build control packets for the Sierra Olympic cameras.

The link here is a Doxygen link to the [Documentation](https://davemers0160.github.io/edt_pdv_test/html/index.html) of the classes to build all of the control packets.
